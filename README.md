Note: The main purpose of this repository is to share source codes for HomeWorks.

Disclaimer:  Only those files which have a commit description reflecting the name/description of the homework are approved and finalized. As an example for HW2 the commit is "K-Means HW" so this file is finalized; but for Contingency HW, its commit description is "adding a not final version of contingency hw", obviously, this is not the final version of the HW.
